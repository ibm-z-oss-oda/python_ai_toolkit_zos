# The Python AI Toolkit for IBM z/OS
This is a library of Python packages that provide a foundation for much of the AI and 
machine learning stack on IBM z/OS.  The information contained here can be used to manage 
your Python deployment into development and production environments in your z/OS
enterprise.

Two other key resources are provided to effectively use this toolkit:
- _**The package index**_.  For research and discovery of the functions available in the toolkit.
  - [https://ibm-z-oss-oda.github.io/python_ai_toolkit_zos/](https://ibm-z-oss-oda.github.io/python_ai_toolkit_zos/)
- _**The package repository**_.  Configure your pip environment to use this package repository
rather than the default community pypi.org.  This can be accomplished in several ways.  See
the Discussions for information on how to configure your environment appropriately.

The _requirements_ directory of this repository contains a collection of 
```requirements.txt``` files that represent the full contents of the toolkit at different 
points in time.  They are released on a quarterly basis to provide a current package listing
on a regular cadence.  Keep in mind that like all open source projects, this toolkit is 
dynamic and evolves.  The requirements files serve as a canonical list of the toolkit
contents over time.
