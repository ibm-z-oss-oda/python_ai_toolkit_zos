# Reference Documentation for the Python AI Toolkit for IBM z/OS
The Python AI Toolkit for IBM z/OS (a.k.a "the Toolkit") is a library of packages that are used 
together with the 
[IBM Open Enterprise SDK for Python](https://www.ibm.com/products/open-enterprise-python-zos) to 
provide a runtime environment supporting AI and machine learning workloads on z/OS.  The SDK includes 
the Python interpreter and pip package manager, which are primary interfaces for interacting with the 
packages of the Toolkit.  Through these interfaces, the Toolkit provides the common Python experience 
that users from other platforms will recognize.

This documentation describes key parts of the Python environment on z/OS that include insights about 
how Python is structured, how it is managed, and how to get the most out of z/OS through Python 
interfaces.  Relevant topics include:

- [A History of Python Package Management on z/OS](./package_mgmt_history.md)
- Python and supply chain security
- Secure access to the Toolkit
- Best practices for Toolkit Deployment
