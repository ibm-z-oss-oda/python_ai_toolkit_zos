        "SET_UP_ENV_OVERVIEW1" : "Packages for this toolkit are managed using the Python Package Installer, pip.  Pip has a command line interface that pulls packages from a repository hosted locally, or by a package provider.  For this toolkit, IBM is providing the repository server with all the toolkit packages that have been built and vetted for vulnerabilities by IBM.  This requires that your environment provides firewall access to the ibm.net domain.",
        "SET_UP_ENV_OVERVIEW2" : "In addition to python packages, the toolkit includes reference requirements.txt files that list all the packages in the toolkit, as well as some configuration information that tells pip where to find the package repository that IBM hosts.  Think of requirements.txt as a recipe that tells pip how to install everything in the toolkit.",
        "SET_UP_ENV_OVERVIEW3_1" : "You can also create global, per-user, and per-environment configurations for running pip, rather than rely on the settings provided in the reference requirements files.  Pip has a well-structured configuration mechanism that is thoroughly described at ",

        "SET_UP_ENV_INDIV_PACKAGES_STEPS2" : "This will provide defaults that prevent you from unintentionally referencing the default python package repository at pypi.org.  There are many more configuration settings that can be added to pip.conf that are all described at the pip documentation site above, so it's worth researching to create a well-structured python configuration for all pip uses across users and different python environments.",

        "ACQUIRE_PACKAGES_OVERVIEW4" : "The pip package installer is required to pull packages into your local environment.  Pip can be used to install all packages from the toolkit at once, or you can use it to install individual packages.  Whichever method you use, it's strongly recommended that you use the hashes associated with each package to avoid mistakes and ensure you get the exactly what you're looking for.",

Be sure to use the version of the requirements file that corresponds to your python environment - cp310 for python 3.10, and cp311 for python 3.11.  Several packages listed in these requirements files contain compiled code that must be compatible with your python environment.  Also use the latest version of these requirements files to get the latest versions of these packages.  Older requirements files are retained for reference purposes, but only the most recent versions are meant for installation.",

By default, pip will install packages from pypi.org, but it can be configured to only pull packages from Python AI Toolkit for IBM z/OS. Refer to the set up environment tab for more details on configuration.",
        "ACQUIRE_INDIV_PACKAGES_STEPS1" : "It's strongly discouraged to simply install python packages from the pip command line without also specifying the hash for that package.  Pip provides a --hash option when installing from a requirements file.  However, this file can contain individual packages to install rather than all toolkit packages.  The web pages of this site provide these hash details for each hosted package.  For instance, if installing the pyyaml package the pull string would look something like this:",
        "ACQUIRE_INDIV_PACKAGES_STEPS2" : "The pip command line only supports the --hash option from within a requirements file, so you can just paste the pull string above into a text file with a name of your choosing.  This file can optionally include configuration information to reach the IBM repository server, so that a minimal requirements file for installing pyyaml might look like this:",
        "ACQUIRE_INDIV_PACKAGES_STEPS3" : "Then simply run pip in the same way as above:",
        "ACQUIRE_INDIV_PACKAGES_STEPS4" : "This is the most secure way to manage your python packages.  It ensures that you will use the IBM-hosted repository, and that you will request the exact package instance that IBM has provided.  If you accidentally mis-configure your environment for installation, the hash will prevent you from unintentionally pulling your package from a different repository server.  There is no way to accidentally install a package that happens to have the right name and version number.",

It is a collection of Python packages that can be installed and managed using Package Installer for Python (pip), the common Python package manager.
